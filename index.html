        My favorite hobbies are games and coding but I chose coding more because it is productive and fun even though games are also fun I would say coding is more important because I could have a coding career! But I have a hard time memorizing things luckily there is something called practice so I can get better!

        The reason coding is fun for me is that I love typing fast and seeing an output espically if that is an output that I made! I also feel very proud when im done with a projet or a app. If I ever get bored of one thing in coding I can always learn more becuase to master coding you have to take a long journey!
